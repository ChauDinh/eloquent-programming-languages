# Eloquent Programming Languages

This repo is my try to other programming languages. I usually work with JavaScript (and TypeScript, NodeJS also) as a web developer but I think learning new stuff would help me understand deeply the core concepts, including object-oriented design, functional programming, gabarge collection, pointers, etc.

I would give a try for several languages: C, C++, Java, Python, Swift and Ruby.

### What we will cover?
